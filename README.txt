Programming of Complex Software Systems

Battleships:

By Frederik Aarestrup Carlsen and Mikkel TÃ¸t
===============================================
How to run:

The game is set to run on localhost by default, so simply do all of these steps on one computer.

1. Run the "server.exe" file. This has to run but can be minimized after starting it.

2. Open "client.exe" twice. 

After ship placement, the clients will the connect to the server and the game will initate.

===============================================
How to play:

The rules of the game are very similar to the original battleship, though with a few tweeks.

The players must first, each, place down their battleships.

The client will state for the player, what size ship they need to place.

First, enter a X coordiante and press enter, then enter a Y coordinate and press enter, lastly, write the direction you whish for the ship to be placed (up/down/left/right). For example: 

X = 3, Y = 8, Direction = Up.

The player will then see the ship placed on their board, and is asked to place the next ship until all four are placed.

When both players have set their ships, the attacking phase begins.

Both players will enter the x and y coordinates for where they whish to attack the other player.

Furthermore, they will be asked wheater they whish to use their "Super Attack", which is a devastating 3x3 attack that can only be used once.

If your opponent hit your ship, it will be marked with an X. If you hit an enemy ship, you are greeted with a "You hit!" message.

When a player has destroyed all of the enemy ships, they win.

===============================================
Distribution of work:

The program can be split into different parts:
- Client networking
- Server networking
- Multithreading
- Battleships

Within battleships, these subcategories exist:
- Base structure
- Grid
- addShip()
- placeShips()
- attack()
- hasLost()
- drawGrid()

These areas were largely made in collaboration, and the commits on github are very misleading as collaborated code is still only committed by 1 person.
However, each area had a main contributor, which can be seen below.

========
Frederik:

Created the networking base, used for both client and server networking.
Created multithreaded client sockets.
Created the attack() function, along with the 3x3 attack.
=======
Mikkel:

Fletched the networking base into the program, as it was created after the battleships code was written.
Created the Base Structure and Grid.
Stood for Grid-based functions, like addShip(), placeShips(), hasLost(), and drawGrid().
